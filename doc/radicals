This document explains the "radical" system of Japanese
Kanji for those who don't read Japanese.

A radical (部首 - ぶしゅ) is a special kind of Kanji
character. They can be categorized by how many strokes they
have. The radicals are:

(based on the radical chart from

 1 Each Kanji has a "radical" associated with it, e.g. rad
   of 相 is 目

 2 Generally, the radical is roughly associated with the
   meaning of the Kanji

   * e.g. radical of 地 (Earth, land - ち) is 土 (soil -
     つち)

 3 The radical of a radical is itself.

 4 Radicals have a particular order, as above, and that
   order is used to sort characters in dictionaries.

 5 So, learning radicals has a practical use - you can look
   up Kanji in a dictionary almost as easily as looking up
   an English word.

 6 Nusort treats radicals a little differently, for
   simplicity's sake:

   a All 1-stroke radicals are considered the same one.

   b The following radicals are a little easy to mix up, so
     they are treated as the same as well
       人 (person - ひと)
       儿 (hitoashi - ひとあし)
       入 (enter - はいる)
       八 (eight - はち)

   c Same goes for:
       匚 (hakogamae - はこがまえ)
       匸 (kakushigamae - かくしがまえ)

   d As well as
       日 (sun - ひ)
       曰 (say - いわく)

 7 These four sets of "combined" radicals consist of
   radicals that are consecutive in the canonical order,
   listed above.

 8 Other radicals which are easy to confuse are not
   "combined" in this fashion, as it would likely result in
   other kinds of confusion when using a normal dictionary.

    * The radicals of 都 (capital - みやこ) and 降 (fall -
      ふる) are different: 邑 (oozato - おおざと) and 阜
      (hill - おか) respectively, even though they have an
      identical variant. They can be distuingished based on
      what side of the Kanji they appear on.

    * 肉 (meat - にく) often looks just like 月 (moon -
      つき) when it appears as a radical, but the two
      radicals are easy to distinguish based on the meaning
      of the character they appear in.

 9 Radicals have multiple forms, and sometimes the same
   radical has different stroke counts depending on its
   variant. For instance:

   * e.g. a variant of 水 (mizu, water, 4 strokes) is 氵 (3
     strokes).

 a The strokes in the character besides the radical are
   called the residual stroke count (we don't care about the
   *total* stroke count).

   * e.g. 汗 (sweat - あせ) has the radical 氵 (a variant of
     水). Its residual stroke count is 3.

 b Characters in the Kanji Database are sorted first by
   radical, then by residual stroke count.
